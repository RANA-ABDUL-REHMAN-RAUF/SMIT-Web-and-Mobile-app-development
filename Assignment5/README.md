## Responsive Design
This assignment demonstrates responsive web design principles:
- **Mobile-first approach** using Bootstrap's responsive grid system
- Breakpoints: `col-sm-12` (mobile), `col-md-6` (tablet), `col-lg-3` (desktop)
- Navigation collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens
- All images and content adapt to different screen sizes

## Notes
- All content is static; form submission is non-functional.
- Images are local assets located in `images/`.
- This is a responsive design assignment showcasing Bootstrap 5 grid system.
