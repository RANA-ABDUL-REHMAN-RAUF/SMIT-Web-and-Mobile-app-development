# Assignment 1 — SMIT Web & Mobile App Development (Course Website)

## Overview
This repository contains a small static website created as part of the SMIT  Web Design & Development exercises. It is a simple multi-page static site (UI-only) demonstrating basic HTML layout, images, media, forms and navigation.

## What I reviewed
I inspected all HTML files in `01_HTML/` and the media files referenced. The site is static with several pages and mock UI elements (login form, contact form, gallery, media player). No backend code or form-processing scripts are present.

## Pages (located in 01_HTML/)
- index.html — Home page (headings, lists, definition list examples)
- about.html — About / chairman message
- gallery.html — Images and `<figure>/<figcaption>` examples
- media.html — Audio and video examples (uses local Media files)
- contact.html — Contact form mockup (static)
- login.html — Login form mockup
- register.html — Register page (placeholder)

## Technologies used
- HTML5 (static)
- Basic inline CSS (present in each HTML file)
- Browser-native audio/video controls

## How to view locally
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `01_HTML/index.html` (or any page) in a web browser. No server required — static files only.
3. Ensure the `Media/` folder is present and images/media are not renamed so they load correctly.
