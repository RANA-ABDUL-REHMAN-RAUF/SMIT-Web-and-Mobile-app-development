# Assignment 1: Basic HTML Website

## Overview

This project is the first assignment for the SMIT Web and Mobile App Development course. It is a simple, static, multi-page website designed to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of HTML5. The site includes various pages to showcase different HTML elements, such as text formatting, lists, images, media (audio and video), and forms.

## Pages Included

-   `index.html`: The main landing page, which introduces the website and includes examples of headings, paragraphs, and lists.
-   `about.html`: An "About Us" page containing descriptive text.
-   `gallery.html`: A gallery page that displays a collection of images.
-   `media.html`: A page that embeds and plays audio and video files.
-   `contact.html`: A page with a contact form for user inquiries.
-   `login.html`: A page with a user login form.
-   `register.html`: A page with a user registration form.

## Key Features and HTML Concepts

-   **Navigation**: A consistent header with a navigation menu is present on all pages, allowing users to move between the different sections of the site. The navigation is built using an HTML `<table>`.
-   **Media**: The website uses `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` tags to embed multimedia content.
-   **Forms**: The `contact.html`, `login.html`, and `register.html` pages demonstrate the use of HTML forms with various input types.
-   **Styling**: Basic styling is applied using inline CSS and internal stylesheets within the `<style>` tag in each HTML file.
-   **File Paths**: The project uses relative file paths to link to other pages and media assets.
