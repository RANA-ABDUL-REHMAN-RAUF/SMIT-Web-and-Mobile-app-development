## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- A code editor for viewing the source code (e.g., VS Code).

### How to Run

Since all projects are static front-end code, no special build process is required.

1.  **Clone or download** this repository.
2.  Navigate into any of the assignment folders (e.g., `01_HTML/`, `02_CSS/Assignment_1/`).
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.
4.  For a better development experience, you can run a simple local web server from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    # If you have Python installed
    python -m http.server

    # If you have Node.js installed
    npx http-server
    ```

    Then, access the projects at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by the server).
