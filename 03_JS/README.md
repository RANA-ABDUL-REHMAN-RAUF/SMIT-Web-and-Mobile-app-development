# JavaScript Assignments

## 📚 Overview

This folder contains JavaScript assignments completed as part of the **Web and Mobile App Development** course at SMIT (Saylani Mass IT Training). These assignments focus on fundamental JavaScript concepts, from basic variables and data types to more advanced topics like conditional logic and DOM manipulation.

## 📋 Assignments

### Assignment 1 - JavaScript Fundamentals (Chapters 1-7)

An interactive web application demonstrating core JavaScript concepts including data types, alerts, variables, and arithmetic operations. The assignment features a clean, modern interface with Bootstrap styling and interactive buttons that showcase various JavaScript functionalities.

- **Topics Covered:** Introduction to JavaScript, Data Types, Alert Functionality, Arithmetic Operations, Variable Naming Conventions, camelCase Examples, DOM Manipulation

### Assignment 2 - JavaScript Conditionals & Prompts (Chapters 8-14)

This assignment explores conditional logic, user input with prompts, and string concatenation. It includes interactive examples for `if-else` statements, nested conditions, and logical operators, allowing users to see how JavaScript responds to different inputs.

- **Live Demo:** [https://aman-js2.netlify.app/](https://aman-js2.netlify.app/)
- **Topics Covered:** String Concatenation, Prompts, `if-else` and `else if` statements, Nested `if` statements, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators.

### Assignment 3 - JavaScript Arrays, Loops & DOM (Chapters 15-20)

This assignment focuses on arrays, array methods, and `for` loops, along with basic DOM manipulation. Users can print and add cities to an array, and generate a multiplication table dynamically.

- **Live Demo:** [https://aman-js3.netlify.app/](https://aman-js3.netlify.app/)
- **Topics Covered:** Arrays, `push()`, `for` loops, DOM updates with `innerHTML` / `innerText`, Toastify-based validation.

### Assignment 4 - JavaScript Strings & Methods (Chapters 21-25)

This assignment demonstrates common string methods and text formatting. It includes converting text to lowercase/uppercase/capitalized, replacing characters, working with a list of cities, and providing feedback via Toastify.

- **Live Demo:** [https://aman-js4.netlify.app/](https://aman-js4.netlify.app/)
- **Topics Covered:** `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`, `charAt()`, `slice()`, `replace()`, `includes()`, arrays, DOM manipulation, Toastify notifications.

### Assignment 5 - Numbers, Integers & Decimals (Chapters 26-30)

This assignment practices numeric operations and `Math` methods. It rounds numbers, generates random numbers and dice values, creates strong passwords, controls decimal length with `toFixed()`, and calculates GST.

- **Live Demo:** [https://aman-js5.netlify.app/](https://aman-js5.netlify.app/)

- **Topics Covered:** `Math.round()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.floor()`, `Math.random()`, string-to-number conversion, `toFixed()`, percentage/GST calculations, input validation.

### Assignment 6 - JavaScript Date, Time & Functions (Chapters 31-38)

Focuses on the `Date` object, handling functions with parameters, and utilizing `setInterval` for high-precision timing. Includes real-world logic like calculating total days lived and determining the weekday of upcoming birthdays.

- **Live Demo:** [https://aman-js6.netlify.app/](https://aman-js6.netlify.app/)
- **Topics Covered:** `new Date()`, `getDay()`, `getTime()`, `setInterval()`, Functions with return values, Input validation with Toastify.
